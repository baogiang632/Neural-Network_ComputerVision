# Neural-Network_ComputerVision
A Neural Network home work:
1. Collect MNIST and Fashion-MNIST dataset
2. Design a 3-layer neural network: an input layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer
3. Experiment with the number of hidden nodes with: 100, 200 and 500 on datasets
4. Increase the number of hidden layers to 2 and 3
5. Conclusion and best practice recommendations.
